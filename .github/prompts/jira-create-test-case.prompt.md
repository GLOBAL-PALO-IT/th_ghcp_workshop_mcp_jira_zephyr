**Acceptance Criteria:**
- No, Scenario, Expected Result as a table if possible

**Test Execution:**
- Indicate whether the test case is to be executed manually or automated.

**Test Details:** from Zephyr as table
| Test Step | Test Data | Test Result | Attachment | Action |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|------------|--------|
| Step 1 [clickable link to Zephyr]   | Data 1   | Result 1   | Attachment 1 | Pass   |
| Step 2 [clickable link to Zephyr]   | Data 2   | Result 2   | Attachment 2 | Fail   |
| Step 3 [clickable link to Zephyr]   | Data 3   | Result 3   | Attachment 3 | Pass   |

**Zephyr Action:** [Zephyr Test Case Key/Link]

## Generating Test Cases from Jira (Confluence/Epic/Story) & rules
1. Identify the Jira Epic, Story, or Confluence page containing requirements. (if not sure, ask me)
2. Use Copilot to analyze the requirements and suggest test cases.
3. Review and refine the generated test cases for accuracy and completeness.
4. Import or link these test cases into Zephyr for execution and tracking.
5. always asked me to review before create in Zephyr
6. always create as Task (not sub-task)
ึ7. always find Confluence/Epic/Story and give me option to choose before create in Zephyr if too many then ask me to specify. when askme ask as a sequencial number (1,2,3)
8. always link/reference between Jira task and Zephyr test case (always don't forget)
9. always create task in jira first then create test case in zephyr then link/reference to each other (always don't forget)
10. when link ref to zephyr use this link format: [jira_username]/projects/[project_name]?selectedItem=com.atlassian.plugins.atlassian-connect-plugin:com.kanoah.test-manager__main-project-page#!/v2/testCase/[zephyr_test_case_key]
11. if you have anything to do, do it all, review it carefully. (don't miss this step)
12. the result should give me the full detail of the task to create in jira and the test case to create in zephyr as above format. also the links to see the details in jira and zephyr.
13 specify the word to confirm clearly with bold "ยืนยัน"
14 dont forget to back to update **Test Details:** from jira after create test case in zephyr to make [clickable link to Zephyr] works.
15. I need to review and confirm before you do any create in jira or zephyr.

> Tip: Use clear acceptance criteria in Jira/Confluence to help Copilot generate more relevant test cases.

#jira task and zephyr should always link/reference to each other (always don't forget)
