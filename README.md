# AI-Powered Testing: Copilot Meets Jira & Zephyr

## Objective

- Setup Zephyr MCP Tool
- Hands-on with Zephyr Features
- Automated Test Case Generation – From Jira Epic/Story/Confluence to Zephyr

## Generating Test Cases from Jira (Confluence/Epic/Story)

1. Identify the Jira Epic, Story, or Confluence page containing requirements.
2. Use Copilot to analyze the requirements and suggest test cases.
3. Review and refine the generated test cases for accuracy and completeness.
4. Import or link these test cases into Zephyr for execution and tracking.

> Tip: Use clear acceptance criteria in Jira/Confluence to help Copilot generate more relevant test cases.
